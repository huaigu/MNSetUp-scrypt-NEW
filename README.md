## 1. Desktop Wallet Preparation

### 1.1 Setup the wallet

## 2. Masternode Setup

### 2.1 Send the coins to your wallet
1. Open Console (Tools => Debug console)
1. Create a new address. `getnewaddress MN1`
1. Send exactly 50000 coins to this address. (One transaction, pay attention to the fee)
1. Wait for the 1 confirmation.
1. Generate a new masternode private key `masternode genkey`.
1. Take txID of collateral transaction  `masternode outputs`. 
1. Do not close console, or copy results to any place.

### 2.2 VPS setup
1. Register on [Aruba] https://www.arubacloud.com/vps/virtual-private-server-range.aspx and setup small VPS server (for 1 eur/month).
Also you can use [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com) or [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) (do not forget verify your e-mail)
1. Send some money to your account to deploy a server. 
1.  - Server Type: Ubuntu 16.04
    - Server Size: 1GB memory (This server is capable to run 3 masternodes. One masternode need 150-300Mb memory)

### 2.3 Automatic Masternode Setup

1. Start putty and login as root user. (Root password and server ip address is in VPS overview tab)

```
bash <( curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Trittium/MNSetUp-scrypt-NEW/master/install.sh )

```

   MN1 IP:30001 masternodeprivkey [25k desposit transaction id. 'masternode outputs'] [25k desposit transaction index. 'masternode outputs']
   Past your transaction id. and transaction index from step 2.1. For example 629dc27b721f57c97550868cac9f7e41049d12cce8ac344732b7f74a9fc81815  0.

## 3. FAQ


1. How to get masternode profit?
	- Enable coin controll feature (Settings => Options => Display => Display coin controll feature)
	- Go send tab
	- Select from the input button only the 5 coin lines
	- Click OK
	- You can send selected amount to an address.
	- Note: DO NOT EVER Transfer TRTT from that original 50k deposit or you'll break your Masternode.
1. What is the password for the tritt account on VPS?
	- There is no default password. When you create a user it does not have a password.
1. I get the following error: "Could not allocate vin"
	- Make sure your wallet fully synced and UNLOCKED.
1. How many masternodes can I run using one IP/server?
	- The limit is only the memory. One masternode requires 150-300MB ram. A server with 1GB memory can run 3 masternodes. But only one Trittium MN can work with one public IP.
1. I got stuck. Can you help me?
